    <h2>Usage.</h2>
    <p>First, right inside the <code>index.html</code> file, you have a style, inside that you have the color pallate,
      that you can easily change, up next edit all the text inside it, or add elements, you can see them in the
      <RouterLink to="/demo">Demo Page</RouterLink>, with that, for example if you want the warning element, you just
      create a section, and add the <code>id</code> "warning", inside it and the <code>&lt;h1 /&gt;</code> and the <code>&lt;p /&gt;</code>.
      It's that easy.
