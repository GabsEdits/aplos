::: info
This project is still a work in progress; many new and better things will be added.

Besides Apl√≥s being a Vitepress theme & SCSS framework, it also includes a simple HTML & CSS template. It's nicely paired with components that help you create a website in minutes. Luckily, it's really easy to set up.

## Installation

Clone it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GabsEdits/aplos
```

Once you've cloned it, start editing the `index.html` file, and you're done!

## Usage

First, inside the `index.html` file, you have a style section containing the color palette, which you can easily change. Next, edit all the text inside it or add elements. You can see them in the [Demo Page](/demo). For example, if you want the warning element, create a section and add the `id` "warning." Inside it, include the `<h1 />` and the `<p />`. It's that easy.
