## Usage.

First, right inside the `index.html` file, you have a style, inside that you have the color pallate, that you can easily change, up next edit all the text inside it, or add elements, you can see them in the [Demo Page](/demo), with that, for example if you want the warning element, you just create a section, and add the `id` "warning", inside it and the `<h1 />` and the `<p />`. It's that easy.
