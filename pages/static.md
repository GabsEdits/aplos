# Static Template

Besides Apl√≥s being a VitePress theme, it also includes a simple HTML & CSS template referred to as the 'Static Template'. It's nicely paired with components that help you create a website in minutes. Luckily, it's really easy to set up.

<div class="table-small">

|    Table of Content   |
| --------------------- |
| [Installation](#installation) |
| [Usage](#usage) |
| [Deployment](#deployment) |
</div>


## Installation

Getting it on your local machine by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GabsEdits/aplos
```

Once you've got it cloned, dive into the index.html file, make your tweaks, and done!

## Usage

Inside the `index.html` file, you'll find a style section with a customizable color palette. Want a change? Go for it! Modify the text, add elements as you wish. For a inspiration, check out the [Demo Page](/demo/). Creating cards like the warning card? Just add an element with the id "`warning`", toss in an `<h1 />` and a `<p />`, and you're good to go.

::: warning
This template might lag a bit behind the latest versions, usually a few releases behind of the absolute newest. For example, if the current version is `1.1.0`, the template might be at `1.0.0-rc.1`. I intentionally do this to focus more on the main version's improvement than playing catch-up with every release. Fear not; after two major point releases (`0.X.0`, where `X` is the major point), the template gets a shiny update to the latest version.

::: details Heads Up
Some elements, like the 404 page, are designed specifically for the VitePress theme.
